# Password Generator with Blacklist
This is a simple password generator that allows you to create secure and random passwords while also providing the option to blacklist certain characters or words that you do not want included in the generated password.

The project was my first programming project, and it was challenging at times, but through consistent effort and improvement, I was able to achieve my goal and create a functional and user-friendly password generator.

To use the password generator, simply run the program and follow the prompts. You will be asked to input the desired length of the password, as well as any characters or words that you would like to blacklist. The program will then generate a random password for you, ensuring that it does not contain any blacklisted characters or words.

This program is a simple but effective tool for creating secure passwords for all your online accounts.

Enjoy!
